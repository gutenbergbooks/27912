<h2><a name="GLOUCESTER_MOORS" id="GLOUCESTER_MOORS"></a>GLOUCESTER MOORS</h2>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A mile behind is Gloucester town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the fishing fleets put in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mile ahead the land dips down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the woods and farms begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, where the moors stretch free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the high blue afternoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the marching sun and talking sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the racing winds that wheel and flee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the flying heels of June.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue is the quaker-maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild geranium holds its dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long in the boulder's shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wax-red hangs the cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the huckleberry boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In barberry bells the grey moths sup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or where the choke-cherry lifts high up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet bowls for their carouse.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Over the shelf of the sandy cove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beach-peas blossom late.<br /></span>

<!-- Page 2 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>

<span class="i0">By copse and cliff the swallows rove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each calling to his mate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seaward the sea-gulls go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the land-birds all are here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That green-gold flash was a vireo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yonder flame where the marsh-flags grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a scarlet tanager.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This earth is not the steadfast place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We landsmen build upon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From deep to deep she varies pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while she comes is gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath my feet I feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her smooth bulk heave and dip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With velvet plunge and soft upreel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She swings and steadies to her keel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a gallant, gallant ship.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These summer clouds she sets for sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun is her masthead light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tows the moon like a pinnace frail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where her phosphor wake churns bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hid, now looming clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the face of the dangerous blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The star fleets tack and wheel and veer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on, but on does the old earth steer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if her port she knew.<br /></span>
</div>

<!-- Page 3 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God, dear God! Does she know her port,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she goes so far about?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or blind astray, does she make her sport<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To brazen and chance it out?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watched when her captains passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She were better captainless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men in the cabin, before the mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some were reckless and some aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some sat gorged at mess.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By her battened hatch I leaned and caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds from the noisome hold,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cursing and sighing of souls distraught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cries too sad to be told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I strove to go down and see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they said, "Thou art not of us!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned to those on the deck with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, "Give help!" But they said, "Let be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our ship sails faster thus."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue is the quaker-maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The alder-clump where the brook comes through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breeds cresses in its shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be out of the moiling street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its swelter and its sin!<br /></span>

<!-- Page 4 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Who has given to me this sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And given my brother dust to eat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when will his wage come in?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scattering wide or blown in ranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yellow and white and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boats and boats from the fishing banks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come home to Gloucester town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is cash to purse and spend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are wives to be embraced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearts to borrow and hearts to lend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearts to take and keep to the end,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O little sails, make haste!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But thou, vast outbound ship of souls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What harbor town for thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shapes, when thy arriving tolls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall crowd the banks to see?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall all the happy shipmates then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand singing brotherly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or shall a haggard ruthless few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warp her over and bring her to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the many broken souls of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fester down in the slaver's pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing to say or do?<br /></span>

<h2><a name="GOOD_FRIDAY_NIGHT" id="GOOD_FRIDAY_NIGHT"></a>GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT</h2>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the bird that sang so long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In twilight circles, hushed his song:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the ancient square<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars came here and there.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Good Friday night! Some hearts were bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some amid the waiting crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of too much youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt not that mystic ruth;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And of these hearts my heart was one:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor when beneath the arch of stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dirge and candle flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cross of passion came,<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="i0">For manifest in that disastrous light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall discern the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do it, tardily.&mdash;O ye who lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take heed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blindness we may forgive, but baseness we will smite.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THE_QUARRY" id="THE_QUARRY"></a>THE QUARRY</h2>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Between the rice swamps and the fields of tea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met a sacred elephant, snow-white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his back a huge pagoda towered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of brass gods and food of sacrifice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his forehead sat a golden throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The massy metal twisted into shapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grotesque, antediluvian, such as move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In myth or have their broken images<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sealed in the stony middle of the hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A peacock spread his thousand dyes to screen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow sunlight from the head of one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sat upon the throne, clad stiff with gems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heirlooms of dynasties of buried kings,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself the likeness of a buried king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With frozen gesture and unfocused eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trappings of the beast were over-scrawled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With broideries&mdash;sea-shapes and flying things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fan-trees and dwarfed nodosities of pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with old alphabets, and faded lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fallen from ecstatic mouths before the Flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gathered by the daughters when they walked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eastward in Eden with the Sons of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom love and the deep moon made garrulous.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Between the carven tusks his trunk hung dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind as the eyes of pearl in Buddha's brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beaded eyes stared thwart upon the road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feebler than the doting knees of eld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His joints, of size to swing the builder's crane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the war-walls of the Anakim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made vain and shaken haste. Good need was his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hasten: panting, foaming, on the slot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came many brutes of prey, their several hates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid by until the sharing of the spoil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as they gathered stomach for the leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun was darkened, and wide-balanced wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat downward on the trade-wind from the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wheel of shadow sped along the fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the dreaming cities. Suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart misgave me, and I cried aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Alas! What dost thou here? What dost <i>thou</i> here?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great beasts and the little halted sharp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyed the grand circler, doubting his intent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway the wind flawed and he came about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stooping to take the vanward of the pack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turned, between the chasers and the chased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying a word I could not understand,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stiller-tongued, with eyes somewhat askance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They settled to the slot and disappeared.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two hours, two hours: God give me strength for it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who has given so much strength to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing to my child, must give to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What more I need to try and save my child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And get for him the life I owe to him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think that I may get it for him now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he knows how much he might have missed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other boys have got! The bitterest thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that plagued me when he came was this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How some day he would see the difference,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drag himself to me with puzzled eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ask me why it was. He would have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cruel enough to do it, knowing not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was the question my rebellious heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried over and over one whole year to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And got no answer and no help at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he had asked me, what could I have said?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What single word could I have found to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide me from his searching, puzzled gaze?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some coward thing at best, never the truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth I never could have told him. No,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never could have said, "God gave you me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fashion you a body, right and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sturdy little limbs and chest and neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fun and fighting with your little mates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great feats and voyages in the breathless world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of out-of-doors,&mdash;He gave you me for this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was such a bungler, that is all!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, the old lie&mdash;that thought was not the worst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never have been truthful with myself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by the door where lurked one ghostly thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood with crazy hands to thrust it back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it should dare to peep and whisper out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbearable things about me, hearing which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The women passing in the streets would turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pity me and scold me with their eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was so bad a mother and so slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To learn to help God do his wonder in her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she&mdash;O my sweet baby! It was not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fear that you would see the difference<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between you and the other boys and girls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, no, it was the dimmer, wilder fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you might never see it, never look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of your tiny baby-house of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sit your life through, quiet in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling and nodding at what was not there!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A foolish fear: God could not punish so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet until yesterday I thought He would.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul was always cowering at the blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw suspended, ready to be dealt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moment that I showed my fear too much.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore I hid it from Him all I could,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only stole a shaking glance at it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes in the dead minutes before dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When He forgets to watch. Till yesterday.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For yesterday was wonderful and strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the beginning. When I wakened first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked out at the window, the last snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gone from earth; about the apple-trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung a faint mist of bloom; small sudden green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had run and spread and rippled everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the fields; and in the level sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked something like a presence and a power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all the world, but chiefly unto me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It walked before me when I went to work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all day long the noises of the mill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were spun upon a core of golden sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-spoken words and interrupted songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blessed promise, meant for all the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most for me, because I suffered most.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shooting spindles, the smooth-humming wheels,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rocking webs, seemed toiling to some end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneficent and human known to them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And duly brought to pass in power and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faces of the girls and men at work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met mine with intense greeting, veiled at once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they knew a secret they must keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fear the joy would harm me if they told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before some inkling filtered to my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In roundabout ways. When the day's work was done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lay a special silence on the fields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as I passed, the bushes and the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very ruts and puddles of the road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke to each other, saying it was she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy woman, the elected one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vessel of strange mercy and the sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many loving wonders done in Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To help the piteous earth.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">At last I stopped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked about me in sheer wonderment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What did it mean? What did they want with me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was the matter with the evening now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it was just as bound to make me glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As morning and the live-long day had been?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me, who had quite forgot what gladness was,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who had no right to anything but toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And food and sleep for strength to toil again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that fierce frightened anguish of my love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the poor little spirit I had wronged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With life that was no life. What had befallen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since yesterday? No need to stop and ask!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back there in the dark places of my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I had thrust it, fearing to believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unbelievable mercy, shone the news<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told by the village neighbors coming home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last night from the great city, of a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arisen, like the first evangelists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With power to heal the bodies of the sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In testimony of his master Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who heals the soul when it is sick with sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could such a thing be true in these hard days?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was help still sent in such a way as that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, no! I did not dare to think of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling what weakness and despair would come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the crazy hope broke under me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned and started homeward, faster now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never fast enough to leave behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voices and the troubled happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That still kept mounting, mounting like a sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing far-off like a rush of wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far down the road a yellow spot of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone from my cottage window, rayless yet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the last sunset crimson caught the panes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alice had lit the lamp before she went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her day of pity and unmirthful play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was over, and her young heart free to live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until to-morrow brought her nursing-task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, and made her feel how dark and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That life could be to others which to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was full of dreams that beckoned, reaching hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrilling invitations young girls hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My boy was sleeping, little mind and frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More tired just lying there awake two hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than with a whole day's romp he should have been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not know his mother had come home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after supper I would sit awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside his bed, and let my heart have time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that worst love that stabs and breaks and kills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I thought over to myself by rote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And habit, but I could not feel my thoughts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For still that dim unmeaning happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept mounting, mounting round me like a sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing inward like a wind of wings.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before I lifted up the latch, I knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt no fear; the One who waited there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the low lamplight by the bed, had come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I was his sister and in need.<br /></span>

<!-- Page 32 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>

<span class="i0">My word had got to Him somehow at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And He had come to help me or to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where help was to be found. It was not strange.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange only He had stayed away so long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that should be forgotten&mdash;He was here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pushed the door wide open and looked in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had been kneeling by the bed, and now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-risen, kissed my boy upon the lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turned and smiled and pointed with his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must have fallen on the threshold stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I remember that I felt, not saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The resurrection glory and the peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed from his face and raiment as He went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out by the door into the evening street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I looked, the place about the bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was yet all bathed in light, and in the midst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My boy lay changed,&mdash;no longer clothed upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scraps and shreds of life, but like the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some most fortunate mother. In a breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The image faded. There he lay again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same as always; and the light was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sank with moans and cries beside the bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruelty, O Christ, the cruelty!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come at last and then to go like that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the darkness deeper than before!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, though I heard no sound, I grew aware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some one standing by the open door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the dry vines rustling in the porch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart laughed suddenly. He had come back!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had come back to make the vision true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had not meant to mock me: God was God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Christ was Christ; there was no falsehood there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a quiet footstep cross the room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt a hand laid gently on my hair,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A human hand, worn hard by daily toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with life-long struggle after bread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alice's father. The kind homely voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had in it such strange music that I dreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps it was the Other speaking in him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because His own bright form had made me swoon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its too much of glory. What he brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was news as good as ever heavenly lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had the dear right to utter. He had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day among the crowds of curious folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the great city and the country-side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered to watch the Healer do his work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mercy on the sick and halt and blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his very eyes had seen such things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As awestruck men had witnessed long ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Galilee, and writ of in the Book.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow morning he would take me there<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If I had strength and courage to believe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might be there was hope; he could not say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knew what he had seen. When he was gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lay for hours, letting the solemn waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thundering joy go over and over me.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just before midnight baby fretted, woke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never yet has slept a whole night through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without his food and petting. As I sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeding and petting him and singing soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt a jealousy begin to ache<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worry at my heartstrings, hushing down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gladness. Jealousy of what or whom?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hardly knew, or could not put in words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least it seemed too foolish and too wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When said, and so I shut the thought away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only, next minute, it came stealing back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the change, would my boy be the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As this one? Would he be my boy at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not another's&mdash;his who gave the life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not give, or did not anyhow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could I look in his new eyes to claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole of him, the body and the breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When some one not his mother, a strange man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had clothed him in that beauty of the flesh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps (for who could know?), perhaps, by some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hateful disfiguring miracle, had even<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Transformed his spirit to a better one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better, but not the same I prayed for him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down out of Heaven through the sleepless nights,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best that God would send to such as me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tried to strangle back the wicked pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancied him changed and tried to love him so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No use; it was another, not my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not my frail, broken, priceless little one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cup of anguish, and my trembling star<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When he had dropped asleep again, I rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrestled with the sinful selfishness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark injustice, the unnatural pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fevered at last with pacing to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I raised the bedroom window and leaned out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white moon, low behind the sycamores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silvered the silent country; not a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the myriads summer moves to sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had yet awakened; in the level moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked that same presence I had heard at dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, dispirited and reticent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It walked the moonlight like a homeless thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, how to cleanse me of the cowardice!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How to be just! Was I a mother, then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mother, and not love her child as well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her own covetous and morbid love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it for this the Comforter had come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling at me and pointing with His hand?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;What had He meant to have me think or do,<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">All at once I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A way to save my darling from myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make atonement for my grudging love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the sycamores and up the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down across the river, the wet road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went stretching cityward, silvered in the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who had shrunk from sacrifice, even I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had refused God's blessing for my boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would take him in my arms and carry him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the altar of the miracle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not wait for daylight, nor the help<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of any human friendship; I alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the still miles of country, I alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only my arms to shield him and my feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear him: he should have no one to thank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But me for that. I knew the way was long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knew strength would be given. So I came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon the stars failed; the late moon faded too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think my heart had sucked their beams from them<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To build more blue amid the murky night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its own miraculous day. From creeks and fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fog climbed slowly, blotted out the road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hid the signposts telling of the town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a while rain fell, with sleet and snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What did I care? Baby was snug and dry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some day, when I was telling him of this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would but hug me closer, hearing how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night conspired against us. Better hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than easy, then: I almost felt regret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My body was so capable and strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do its errand. Honeyed drop by drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghostly jealousy, loosening at my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distilled into a dew of quiet tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell with splash of music in the wells<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rocks and bushes looming through the mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Questioned and acquiesced and understood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees and streams believed; the wind and rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even they, for all their temper, had some words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of faith and comfort. But the glaring streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dizzy traffic, the piled merchandise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The giant buildings swarming with fierce life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cared nothing for me. They had never heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me nor of my business. When I asked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My way, a shade of pity or contempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed through men's kindness&mdash;for they all were kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daunted and chilled and very sick at heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walked the endless pavements. But at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streets grew quieter; the houses seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they might be homes where people lived;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the factories and cottages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all was well again. Much more than well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many sick and broken went my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone or helped along by loving hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from a thousand eyes the famished hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked out at mine&mdash;wild, patient, querulous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But always hope and hope, a thousand tongues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaking one word in many languages.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Believingly, in spirit and in truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can such a mercy be, in these hard days?<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wonder can this be the world it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sunset? I remember the sky fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green as pale meadows, at the long street-ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But overhead the smoke-wrack hugged the roofs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to shut the city from God's eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till dawn should quench the laughter and the lights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the gas flare stolid faces passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too dull for sin; old loosened lips set hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drain the stale lees from the cup of sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if a young face yearned from out the mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made by its own bright hair, the eyes were wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With desolate fore-knowledge of the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My life lay waste about me: as I walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the gross dark of unfrequented streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of my own youth peered forth at me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck white with pity at the thing I was;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And globed in ghostly fire, thrice-virginal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lifted face star-strong, went one who sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the void dark came my face and hers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One vivid moment&mdash;then the street was there;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bloat shapes and mean eyes blotted the sear dusk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the curtained window of a house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence sin reeked on the night, a shameful head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was silhouetted black as Satan's face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against eternal fires. I stumbled on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the dark slope that reaches riverward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretching blind hands to find the throat of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crush Him in his lies. The river lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coiled in its factory filth and few lean trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All was too hateful&mdash;I could not die there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I whom the Spring had strained unto her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose lips had felt the wet vague lips of dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So under the thin willows' leprous shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the tangled ranks of riverweed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pushed&mdash;till lo, God heard me! I came forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, 'neath the shoreless hush of region light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through a new world, undreamed of, undesired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond imagining of man's weary heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far to the white marge of the wondering sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This still plain widens, and this moon rains down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insufferable ecstasy of peace.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My heart is man's heart, strong to bear this night's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unspeakable affliction of mute love<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dissemble, feign a busy intercourse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bushes deal in shadowy subterfuge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Utter awestricken purpose of no sense,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I walk quiet, crush aside the hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched furtively to drag me madmen's ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know the thing they suffer, and the tricks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They must be at to help themselves endure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not be too boastful; I am weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too weak to put aside the utter ache<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this lone splendor long enough to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the moon is still her white strange self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or something whiter, stranger, even the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which by the changed face of my risen youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang, globed in fire, her golden canticle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dare not look again; another gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might drive me to the wavering coppice there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where bat-winged madness brushed me, the wild laugh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of naked nature crashed across my blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rank it was with earthy presences,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faun-shapes in goatish dance, young witches' eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slanting deep invitation, whinnying calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambiguous, shocks and whirlwinds of wild mirth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had undone me in the darkness there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that within me, smiting through my lids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lowered to shut in the thick whirl of sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dumb light ached and rummaged, and with out,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The soaring splendor summoned me aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave the low dank thickets of the flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where man meets beast and makes his lair with him,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where stalwart stars reap grain to make the bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God breaketh at his tables and is glad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came out in the moonlight cleansed and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazed up at the lyric face to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sweetness tasted of in earthen cups<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere it be dashed and spilled, all radiance flung<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through tragic twilights when the stricken sea<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In imminent cities built of gorgeous winds<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Along the violet slopes of evensong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the sights that starred the dreamy year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me one sight stood peerless and apart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright rivers tacit; low hills prone and dumb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forests that hushed their tiniest voice to hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skies for the unutterable advent robed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In purple like the opening iris buds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by some lone expectant pool, one tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose gray boughs shivered with excess of awe,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with preluding gush of amber light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And herald trumpets softly lifted through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the palpitant horizon marge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crocus-filleted came the singing moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of her changing lights I wove my youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A place to dwell in, sweet and spiritual,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the bitter years of my exile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart has called afar off unto her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, after many days love finds its own!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The futile adorations, the waste tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hymns that fluttered low in the false dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has uptreasured as a lover's gifts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are the mystic garment that she wears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the bridal, and the crocus flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She twined her brow with at the going forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are the burden of the song she made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In coming through the quiet fields of space,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The myriad silence yearns to myriad speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O sea that yearns a day, shall thy tongues be<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Day grows and it is far to market-town."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once where I lay in darkness after fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sore smitten, thrilled a little thread of song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Searching and searching at my muffled sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until it shook sweet pangs through all my blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I beheld one globed in ghostly fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing, star-strong, her golden canticle;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From east to west one legion! Wilt thou strive?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, since the splendor of her sword-bright gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was heavy on me with yearning and with scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sick heart muttered, "Yea, the little strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet see, the grievous wounds! I fain would sleep."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O heart, shalt thou not once be strong to go<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through his might men work their wills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have boweled out the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For food to keep him toiling in the cages they have wrought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they fling him, hour by hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limbs of men to give him power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brains of men to give him cunning; and for dainties to devour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children's souls, the little worth; hearts of women, cheaply bought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He takes them and he breaks them, but he gives them scanty thought.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For about the noisy land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roaring, quivering 'neath his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His thoughts brood fierce and sullen or laugh in lust of pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the stubborn things that he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks to dust and brings to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some he mightily establishes, some flings down utterly.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quietude and loveliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holy sights that heal and bless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are scattered and abolished where his iron hoof is set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he splashes through the brae<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silver streams are choked with clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he snorts the bright cliffs crumble and the woods go down like hay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lairs in pleasant cities, and the haggard people fret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squalid 'mid their new-got riches, soot-begrimed and desolate.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They who caught and bound him tight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed exultant at his might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, "Now behold, the good time comes for the weariest and the least!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will use this lusty knave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more need for men to slave;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He may struggle, sweat, and yell, but he knows exceeding well<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">He must lead the tyrant weather;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He must cast out hate and fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry away each fruitless tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make the fruitful tears to gush from the deep heart and clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He must give each man his portion, each his pride and worthy place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He must batter down the arrogant and lift the weary face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On each vile mouth set purity, on each low forehead grace.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, perhaps, at the last day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will whistle him away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay a hand upon his muzzle in the face of God, and say,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To skirt the irresistible lure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the flame that has him sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit, that is none too strong to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flutters and makes delay,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pausing to wonder on the perfect lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting to muse upon the low-drawn hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each hid radiance there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But powerless to stem the tide-race bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vehement peace which drifts it toward the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where soon&mdash;ah, now, with cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grief and giving-up unto its gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shrinks no longer nor denies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurriedly home to the exquisite heart of pain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all is well, for I have seen them plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unforgettable, the unforgotten eyes!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Across the blinding gush of these good tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shine as in the sweet and heavy years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When by her bed and chair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We children gathered jealously to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunlit aura breathing myrrh and thyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the sore-stricken body made a clime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gentler than May and pleasanter than rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holier and more mystical than prayer.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">God, how thy ways are strange!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this should be, even this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The patient head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which suffered years ago the dreary change!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these so dewy lips should be the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those I stooped to kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard my harrowing half-spoken name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little ere the one who bowed above her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our father and her very constant lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose stoical, and we knew that she was dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I, who could not understand or share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His antique nobleness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being unapt to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The insults which time flings us for our proof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled from the horrible roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the alien sunshine merciless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shrill satiric fields ghastly with day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raging to front God in his pride of sway<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That ringed Him where He sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My puny gage of scorn and desolate hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which somehow should undo Him, after all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this girl face, expectant, virginal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gazes out at me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boon as a sweetheart, as if nothing loth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Save for the eyes, with other presage stored)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pledge me troth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the kingdom where the heart is lord<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That this should be indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flesh which caught my soul, a flying seed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Deep of divine unrest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They play upon me, and it is not so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, 't&nbsp;is a girl I never saw before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little thing to flatter and make weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tease until her heart is sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then kiss and clear the score;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gypsy run-the-fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little liberal daughter of the earth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The careless season yields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither-side the flood o' the year and yonder of the neap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thank you, thanks again, and twenty light good-byes.&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Darken not, holy eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest well I know that it is thou!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As would unman me quite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in this web of strangeness caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prey to troubled thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do I devise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These foolish shifts and slight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to shield me from the afflicting sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some waste influence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which from this morning face and lustrous hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathes on me sudden ruin and despair.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With any but this girlish depth of gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your coming had not so unsealed and poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dusty amphoras where I had stored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drippings of the winepress of my days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think these eyes foresee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in their unawakened virgin time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their mother's pride in me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You pictured I should climb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broken premonitions come,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The manifest angel with fresh lilies came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intelligibly calling her by name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vanishingly, dumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thwarted and bright and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As heralding a sin-defiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth-encumbered, blood-begotten, passionate man-child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who yet should be a trump of mighty call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown in the gates of evil kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make them fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who yet should be a sword of flame before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul's inviolate door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beat away the clang of hellish wings;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of high unquenchable desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the day of little things.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look, where the amphoras,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yield of many days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trod by my hot soul from the pulp of self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set upon the shelf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sullen pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Vineyard-master's tasting to abide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O mother mine!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of him you used to praise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emptied and overthrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jars lie strown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, for their flavor duly nursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drip from the stopples vinegar accursed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, I thought honied to the very seal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry, dry,&mdash;a little acid meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pinch of mouldy dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole leavings of the amber-mantling must;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, rude to look upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But flasking up the liquor dearest won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through sacred hours and hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With watching and with wrestlings and with grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even of these, of these in chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stale breath sickens, reeking from the shard.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or else, if gaze they must,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steel them with judgment, darken them with blame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by the ways of light ineffable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You bade me go and I have faltered from,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the low waters moaning out of hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereto my feet have come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay not on me these intolerable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks of rejoicing love, of pride, of happy trust!<br /></span>
